# Introduction

This is Repo contains all the artificial intelligence codes that I have implemented in my under-grad journey.

## Quick Start

1. You can implement all these codes using local IDE for python, but for ipynb file extensions you will need to use ANACONDA, JUPYTER or GOOGLE COLAB (most_recommended).

2. Go to <https://colab.research.google.com/>, pick _GITHUB_ source and put the repository details

3. I will also recommend to use colab for most python codes as it is convinient to use colab than other IDE's.

## NOTE

Don't forget to check if your work has been auto saved on colab. If not, always remember to save it... So your efforts don't go to waste!!
